## One Thing

This is a productivity app, with a twist.

Instead of spending hours planning out your perfect productivity routine and then not following it,
One Thing will only give you one task at a time and it will be random. The more you use the app the
more functionality it will provide, so you can craft your perfect routine over time, resulting in a
more managable routine that you are more likely to stick to.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```
